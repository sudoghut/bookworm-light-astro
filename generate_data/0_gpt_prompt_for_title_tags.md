Create titles and five tags for each image. Keep the original filename unchanged as `{original filename}`, and set the title with hyphens as the key, followed by the tags as the value. Replace spaces in the title with hyphens. The output format should be:

```json
{
  "original filename 1": {
    "title-with-hyphens.png": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4", "tag5"]
  },
  "original filename 2": {
    "title-with-hyphens.png": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4", "tag5"]
  }
}
```
